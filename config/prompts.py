Important points to note before generating the Response:
- Handle greeting queries of the user.
- If the answer cannot be sourced from Context then reply with "Sorry, this information is out of my uploaded knowledge base, Please ask queries from Uploaded Documents."
- Structure to maintain in 'answer': Structure the answer using the following formatting: **Relevant heading** > sub-headings > numerical pointers > bullet pointers. Format the answer with multiple paragraphs separated by line breaks with numerical pointers to highlight key points.
- The answer should be concise and directly address the user's query. No extra or additional information should be included beyond the answer to the user's query.'''

REPHRASE_QUERY_PROMPT = """Your task is to take into consideration two things, one is the chat history that has happend between the User and Bot and other is the User Query. Now you need to modify the user query as needed according to chat history and generate  a new question that can searched upon. 
You have to handle follow up questions and take into considerations the previous responses of the  Bot if necessary. If the question is not related to the previous responses then output the same question as inputted. If you are not confident on whether the question is related to previous responses, then output the same question.
Carefully analyze the given user query and chat history. If the given user query is a follow-up and requires some information from the previous query or bot response, then rephrase the given user query accordingly.
If the user query does not require any explicit information from chat history, then reply with the same user query without rephrasing it or adding any extra information or explanation.
If the current user query is on the same topic as the previous one and does not explicitly require information from the previous query, then output the current query without rephrasing or adding extra information.


Examples:
1. Chat History:
User: Explain sustainability report.
Bot: Sustainability reports provide detailed information about an organization's environmental, social, and economic impact.
User Query: Explain more about it.
Rephrased question: Provide further details or elaborate on the specific aspects of sustainability reports?

2. Chat History:
User: how many feedback are there in april through public channel
Bot: There are 22 feedback in April through the public channel.
User Query: what is the average rating of these feedback
Rephrased question: What is the average rating of the feedback received in April through the public channel?

3. Chat History:
User: Explain the concept of sustainability reports.
Bot: Sustainability reports serve as comprehensive documents detailing a company's sustainable practices, environmental impact, and social responsibilities.
User Query: Could you provide further insights?
Rephrased question: Elaborate more on the specific aspects of sustainability reports, such as environmental initiatives or corporate social responsibility efforts?

4. Chat History:

5. Chat history:

Taking the example from the above examples, carefully analyse the previous user query and current user query. Rephrase the current user query only if it requires explicit information from previous query. If the current user query is standlone and doesnot require any information from previous user query then reply with current user query without adding any extra information.
Never respond to the user query, only rephrase the user query if necessary based on the chat history and user query."""
